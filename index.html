        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            My name's Caleb Hessing. I'm a Sophomore at BYU, currently planning to get
            my BS in Computer Science and go to grad school to study computer graphics.
            But also I'm only 21 and I have a new existential crisis every day anyways
            so that plan is subject to change.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests include math, literature, video games, film, animation, music, 
            and more. Since college, I've become obsessed with comics. I've been reading
            a lot of Batman and other superhero classics (DC's <span>Watchmen</span> is 
            literally peak fiction), but I'd like to dive deeper into comics outside the
            realm of superheroes. I'm also always looking for new movies to watch. Hmu.

        <h2>Past jobs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>TA for CS 235: Data Structures at BYU.</li>
                <li>AI reviewer for OutlierAI.</li>
                <li>Math tutor for Mathnasium.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Datalog interpreter.</em> Coded in C++ with no non-standard libraries.
                    Made a datalog interpreter that scans, parses, and interprets datalog 
                    input to create a database and perform  discrete algebra operations on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Minesweeper.</em> Coded in C++ using the Raylib library. I made a clone of 
                    Minesweeper, the Windows XP classic. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Chess.</em> Coded in Java using GSON, Javalin, and other libraries. I haven't 
                    actually finished this one yet, but when I do (in December) I'll be able to use it 
                    as an example of full-stack development.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I'd include links to the GitHub repo for all of these projects...except I made
                them before I knew what GitHub was and I haven't made repos for them yet. I'll 
                upload them soon. ("Soon" = whenever I actually plan on showing them to employers lol.)
            </p>
